# Chinook Data Analysis Project

This project is two parts. Part one is the analysis of Chinook database while part two is the  Prediction of  Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) in the Chinook Database. The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) based on historical sales, customer demographics, and transaction patterns. the visualization was done in the notebook as well as power BI. 
`final project on chinook latest.ipynb` - Contains full data analysis including visualizations and insights from the Chinook database.
- `Chinook model.ipynb` - Includes the development of a machine learning model for predicting sales or customer behavior.

## Project Objectives
**Part one:**
T•	To Identify artists with the highest sales and analyze their sales trends over time. 
•	To  Segment customers based on purchase behavior and identify key characteristics of high-value customers. 
•	To determine the most popular music genres and analyze the change in genre popularity over different periods. 
•	To analyze monthly and yearly sales trends, including seasonal effects and significant sales events. 
•	To calculate the lifetime value of customers based on their purchase history and provide recommendations for improving customer retention. 
•	To perform association rule mining to find common combinations of tracks or albums purchased together.

**Part Two**:  
1. To examine the structure and relationships in the Chinook database using SQL queries and Identify the key tables and attributes needed to calculate Customer Lifetime Value (CLV). 
2. To Use SQL to extract and join relevant data 
3. To create features from the extracted data 
4. Data Preprocessing 
5. Model Building
6. To evaluate the model using metrics such as RMSE or R^2.
7. To save the model for future purposes

## WORK FLOW
.1.  Data Understanding 
• I examinde the structure and relationships in the Chinook database using SQL queries. 
• Identified the key tables and attributes needed to calculate Customer Lifetime Value 
(CLV). 
2. Data Extraction 
• Use SQL to extract and join relevant data 
3. Feature Engineering 
• Create features from the extracted data 
4. Data Preprocessing 
5. Model Building 
• Split the data into training and testing sets. 
• Use regression models to predict the CLV (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, or 
Gradient Boosting). 
• Evaluate the model using metrics such as RMSE or R^2.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need:

-   **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**: These are interactive development environments for working with notebooks. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook jupyterlab
    ```
-   **Python Libraries**: The analysis likely uses various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Common libraries include:
    -   pandas
    -   numpy
    -   matplotlib
    -   seaborn
    -   SQLAlchemy (if connecting directly to the database)
