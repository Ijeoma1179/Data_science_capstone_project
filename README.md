# Chinook Data Analysis Project

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks used for the analysis of the Chinook database.

## Overview

This project explores the Chinook sample database, which represents a digital media store. The analysis focuses on understanding sales trends, customer behavior, and identifying opportunities for business growth.

The repository includes the following notebooks:

-   **final project on chinook latest.ipynb**: This notebook contains the latest and most comprehensive analysis performed on the Chinook database. It likely includes detailed explorations, visualizations, and conclusions.
-   **new chinook model.ipynb**: This notebook seems to contain a new model or a specific analysis focused on a particular aspect of the Chinook data. It might explore different methodologies or business questions compared to the main analysis.

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks, you will need:

-   **Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab**: These are interactive development environments for working with notebooks. You can install them using pip:
    ```bash
    pip install notebook jupyterlab
    ```
-   **Python Libraries**: The analysis likely uses various Python libraries for data manipulation, analysis, and visualization. Common libraries include:
    -   pandas
    -   numpy
    -   matplotlib
    -   seaborn
    -   SQLAlchemy (if connecting directly to the database)
